## The bigger picture

High-dimensional datasets are becoming increasingly abundant in various scientific and engineering disciplines. Making sense of those datasets and building data-driven models based on the collected state variables can be achieved through dimensionality reduction. We show that the quality of reduced data representation can be significantly improved by informing data projections by quantities of interest (QoIs) other than the original state variables. QoIs are often known to researchers as variables that should be well represented on a projection. Our approach of computing ‚ÄúQoI-aware‚Äù projections can find application in all areas of science and engineering that aim to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate datasets, as well as in fundamental research of representation learning.

## Data

Datasets used in this study are stored in the [`data/`](data/) directory. These include multivariate combustion datasets for:

- hydrogen
- syngas
- methane
- ethylene

## Code

The main results can be reproduced using scripts contained in the [`scripts/`](scripts/) directory. The chronology of running these scripts is as follows:

1. [`QoIAwareProjection-train.py`](scripts/QoIAwareProjection-train.py)
2. [`QoIAwareProjection-VarianceData.py`](scripts/QoIAwareProjection-VarianceData.py)
3. [`QoIAwareProjection-kernel-regression-2D.py`](scripts/QoIAwareProjection-kernel-regression-2D.py) and [`QoIAwareProjection-kernel-regression-3D.py`](scripts/QoIAwareProjection-kernel-regression-3D.py)

Scripts 1. and 2. can take a long time to run. Script 2. is parallelized and it is highly recommended that it is run on multiple CPUs. We have completed our computations running this script on 64CPUs, where looping over 100 random seeds for a single dataset takes about 20 hours to complete.

The results for the synthetic dataset from Fig. 2. can be run on multiple CPUs using the following scripts:

1. [`illustrative-example-linear-reconstruction-from-a-subspace.py`](scripts/illustrative-example-linear-reconstruction-from-a-subspace.py)
2. [`illustrative-example-nonlinear-reconstruction-from-a-subspace.py`](scripts/illustrative-example-nonlinear-reconstruction-from-a-subspace.py)
3. [`illustrative-example-costs.py`](scripts/illustrative-example-costs.py)

Our open-source Python library, [**PCAfold**](https://pcafold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), is required. Specifically, the user will need the class [`QoIAwareProjection`](https://pcafold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/utilities.html#class-qoiawareprojection). More information can be found in this [illustrative tutorial](https://pcafold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/demo-qoi-aware-encoder-decoder.html).

For results reproducibility, we use fixed random seeds for neural network initialization and training. The exact values for random seeds can be retrieved from the code provided.
